These three projects took me more than a year and I have started thanks to Digital Native BootCamp:

- Level 1 - HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
- Level 2 - Migration into TypeScript,
- Level 3 - Redeveloping TypeScript into Angular (second migration) [Project Level 3 Angular](https://github.com/Chris2240/SPA-Angular-DN-Project) - this project is linked separately to preserve its full history.

That was such a great time to spend on these projects. Irreplaceable knowledge ;)
